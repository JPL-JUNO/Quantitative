\section{Time series decomposition}
The components of time series can be divided into two types: systematic and non-systematic. The
systematic ones are characterized by consistency and the fact that they can be described and modeled.
By contrast, the non-systematic ones cannot be modeled directly.
The following are the systematic components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Level}—the mean value in the series.
    \item \textbf{Trend}—an estimate of the trend, that is, the change in value between successive time points at any given moment. It can be associated with the slope (increasing/decreasing) of the series. In other words, it is the general direction of the time series over a long period of time.
    \item \textbf{Seasonality}—deviations from the mean caused by repeating short-term cycles (with fixed and
          known periods).
\end{itemize}
The following is the non-systematic component:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Noise}—the random variation in the series. It consists of all the fluctuations that are observed after removing other components from the time series.
\end{itemize}
The classical approach to time series decomposition is usually carried out using one of two types of models: additive and multiplicative.

An \textbf{additive model} can be described by the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Model's form—$y(t) = level + trend + seasonality + noise$
    \item Linear model—changes over time are consistent in size
    \item The trend is linear (straight line)
    \item Linear seasonality with the same frequency (width) and amplitude (height) of cycles over time
\end{itemize}

A \textbf{multiplicative model} can be described by the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Model's form—$y(t) = level * trend * seasonality * noise$
    \item Non-linear model—changes over time are not consistent in size, for example, exponential
    \item A curved, non-linear trend
    \item Non-linear seasonality with increasing/decreasing frequency and amplitude of cycles over time
\end{itemize}
